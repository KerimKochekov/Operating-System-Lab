first code output: 
Hello
Hello
second code output:
Hello


so, difference is that in first code it prints "hello" without passing to new line, so parent-child works parallely waiting for new line, which we also call waiting for flush.
but in the second code, he already flushed after "hello" so in child process it will only proceed newline command
