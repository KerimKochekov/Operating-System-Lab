1)Real-time operating systems use deadlock recovery, which consists of two steps:
a)Killing the process
b)Resource preemption

2) Deadlock prevention can be done by eliminating any of these characteresticts(mutual exclusion,
hold and wait, no preemption, circular wait).

3) Deadlock avoidance can be done with Bankerâ€™s Algorithm.

Recovery method has killing process method, so it can be useful to interupt the proceses when it is not possible to predict outcome and
we dont know how system will use resources, so it might be helpfull to  user preventing method.
